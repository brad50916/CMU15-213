128 This code contains important information about the
128 UC Stones. Each information is crucial for Mr. Evil's plans, and no one can
128 understand what his plans are! That is unless you want an unhappy ending...
99 GOOD LUCK trying to figure out the number you need to move on to the next phase :)
99 64 This is the total number of square feet taken up by the UC Stones.
99 When capturing the stones, all stones must fit within the space. Carnegie Mellon
99 Engineers might be helpful for this project.
99 128 Students have tried to use this approximation to understand how many
99 hundreds of pounds of UC Stones are actually in captivity.... They need to
99 work on their estimation skills.
99 However, the actual amount of captured stones is significantly higher
99 than the weak approximation. We are afraid that the students at Carnegie Mellon
99 need to improve their abilities to estimate.
